# Antennas
This program is an optimization one, it runs a simulation to find the best path between 2 points, the grid is made of antennas, 0 means no antenna, 1 means only adjacent vertical and horizontal antennas are allowed, and 2 means that all 8 adjacent antennas are allowed.

The ui version only allows for a 5x5 grid, if you're looking to make it bigger use the terminal version
